# List Assertions Test

## 📄 Description
This Java project uses AssertJ and JUnit 5 to validate the behavior of an `ArrayList`. It includes tests to verify the order of objects, ensure objects are present in any order, check if an object is added only once, and confirm the absence of specific objects.

### Functionality
1. **Core Features:**
    - Verify that objects are in the correct order.
    - Verify that objects are present regardless of their order.
    - Ensure specific objects are added only once.
    - Confirm that certain objects are not present in the list.

2. **Robust Design:**
    - Implements flexible and fluent assertions with AssertJ.
    - Provides reusable and modular test cases.
    - Demonstrates best practices for testing Java collections.
